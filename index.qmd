# MapAgora Dashboard

Welcome to the **MapAgora Dashboard**, an interactive site that visualizes the availability, composition, and equity of civic opportunities across U.S. counties. This dashboard is part of the *Mapping the Modern Agora (MMA)* project, hosted at the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University, which systematically measures civic infrastructure using large-scale administrative and digital trace data.

### Motivation 🚀 

Today, most people are disconnected from the democratic processes that allow us to engage, deliberate, and make decisions together. Civil society organizations are scattered, and opportunities for meaningful civic participation are often inaccessible.

We’re mapping the modern agora — a visual map of where and how people can engage with each other in the democratic process. By mapping civic opportunities, we aim to strengthen democracy by identifying areas that need more attention and support.

### 📊 Civic Opportunity Dataset Construction 🛠  

To create our datasets on the landscape of civic opportunity in America, we begin with the IRS Exempt Organizations Business Master File — a comprehensive registry of all tax-exempt organizations in the U.S. This registry serves as our sampling frame and includes a broad range of nonprofit entities, even those that don’t file annual tax returns.

Next, we link IRS administrative records with data scraped directly from organization websites. Using a combination of machine learning and natural language processing, we identify the type of each organization and whether it provides civic opportunities such as volunteering, membership, public events, and engaging in civic or political action.

The resulting datasets cover over **1.7 million de-identified nonprofits** and are aggregated at the ZIP code and county levels. Each county is scored along a five-point **Civic Opportunity Index**, with additional indicators for organizational composition and community demographics.

### About This Dashboard   

This dashboard presents only a **subset** of the full *MapAgora* datasets. It includes:

- **County-level aggregates** of civic opportunity counts and organizational types  
- **Interactive visualizations** of these county-level measures

**Explore the Dashboard**  

- 🗺️ [**Interactive Map**](https://snfagora.github.io/agora_dashboard/map.html): View county-level civic opportunity scores, see how each place ranks, and examine the types of organizations driving civic access.  
- 📋 [**Interactive Table**](https://snfagora.github.io/agora_dashboard/table.html): Search, filter, and sort civic opportunity indicators across all U.S. counties, with comparisons to state and national benchmarks.

### 💡 Explore with Questions
Use the following prompts to guide your exploration:

- What kinds of civic organizations are more common in rural vs. urban counties in your state?
- Which counties have especially high or low civic opportunity scores? What might explain those patterns?
- How does your county compare to others nearby—or to the national average?
- What does this data confirm or challenge about your understanding of civic life in your community or region?

### 🔍 Critically Engage with the Data
MapAgora offers a scalable and comprehensive map of America’s civic infrastructure—but no dataset is perfect. This dashboard is an invitation to explore, question, and extend what you see.

If you’re working in a specific place, you might:
- Click into **a few counties** directly on the map,
- Download the ZIP code–level dataset for **more granular views**, or
- Use the organization-level dataset to **reconstruct civic opportunity scores at the city level**.

We encourage users to compare what they find here with **external sources** like Google Maps, Yelp, or local directories. This can help surface civic organizations that may not be captured in the dataset—such as **informal neighborhood groups, mutual aid networks, or online communities**.

These comparisons not only highlight what might be missing, but also why—whether due to registration status, online visibility, or organizational disclosure norms.

Engaging with the data in this way helps refine place-based research, enrich local knowledge, and spark new questions about what counts—and what is counted—in civic life.

**⚠️ Important Note**  

It does **not** include either the full **de-identified organization-level dataset** of 1.7M+ nonprofits 🏢 or the **ZIP code–level aggregates** 📮. This dashboard is limited to **county-level data only** 🗺️.  

For ZIP-level data and detailed metadata on individual organizations, please refer to the full data release 📂.

### Data Access and Paper  

- **Dataset 1**: organization-level dataset of de-identified nonprofit organizations (1,774,798 rows $\times$ 17 columns)  

<details>
<summary><strong>Data descriptions</strong></summary>

This dataset includes 1,774,798 de-identified nonprofit organizations. To protect privacy and reduce the risk of misinterpretation, all identifying information (e.g., organization names and EINs) is removed.

Each observation includes:

- Unique identifier:  
  - `id`: a row index used for reference; contains no identifying information.

- Geographic identifiers:  
  - `state`: two-letter state abbreviation  
  - `city`: city name listed in the IRS record  
  - `FIPS`: county FIPS code  
  - `ZCTA`: ZIP Code Tabulation Area

- Civic opportunity indicators:  
  - `membership`, `volunteer`, `events`, `take_action`: binary variables indicating whether the organization provides each type of civic opportunity (1 = provides the opportunity; 0 = does not provide it or information is unavailable)  
  - `opp_binary`: equals 1 if the organization provides at least one civic opportunity; 0 otherwise  
  - `opp_mean`: the mean of the four civic opportunity binary indicators

- Organizational type:  
  - `predicted`: machine-learned classification of the organization (e.g., religious, political, professional)

- Address metadata:  
  - `is_po`: indicates whether the organization lists a P.O. Box as its mailing address (1 = yes, 0 = no)  
  - `grouping_value`: an anonymized internal identifier used to track federated organizations (e.g., national networks with local chapters)

- Financial attributes:  
  - `asset_amt`: total assets  
  - `income_amt`: total income  
  - `revenue_amt`: total revenue
