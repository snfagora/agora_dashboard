    "text": "📘 Civic Opportunity Counts and Organization Types\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCivic opportunity per capita: A normalized composite score representing the density of civic opportunity in a county. For each organization, we calculate the average of four binary indicators: Membership, Volunteer, Public Events, and Take Civic or Political Action (each scored 0 or 1). These are averaged to produce a score between 0 and 1 per organization. We then sum these scores across all organizations in a county, and normalize the total per 100,000 residents.\n\nExample: If the sum of these averaged scores across all organizations in a county is 1,000, and the county population is 1,000,000, then:\n1,000 ÷ 1,000,000 × 100,000 = 100\nThat means the county has a civic opportunity score of 100 per 100,000 residents.\n\nCivic opportunity index: A simplified version of the score above, divided into five bins (quintiles).\n\n1 = lowest civic opportunity, 5 = highest.\n\nPercentile: National percentile of the civic opportunity per capita score.\n\nExample: A county with a score of 125 that ranks in the top 5% of all counties would be labeled as “Top 5%”.\n\nState Rank: Rank of the county within its state by civic opportunity score per capita.\nNational Rank: Rank of the county across all U.S. counties by civic opportunity score per capita.\nCivic Opportunity Orgs: Count of organizations tagged as offering at least one type of civic opportunity.\nTotal Nonprofits: Total number of nonprofit organizations in the county.\n\n\nSubtypes of Civic Opportunity Organizations\n\nMembership N: Organizations offering membership opportunities.\n\nVolunteer N: Organizations offering volunteer opportunities.\n\nEvents N: Organizations offering public event opportunities.\n\nTake Action N: Organizations offering civic or political action opportunities.\n\n\nCivic Opportunity Organizational Type Breakdown (% of all civic opportunity organizations in the county)\n\nReligious %, Social & Fraternal %, Youth %, Unions %, Healthcare %, Economic %,\nEducation %, Research & Think Tank %, Hobby & Sports %, Community %,\nFoundations %, Professional %, Arts & Cultural %, Housing %, Political %\nEach percentage represents the share of that organization type among all civic opportunity organizations in the county.\nExample: If a county has 100 civic opportunity organizations, and 12 of them are classified as “Religious,” the Religious % would be 12%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📘 Codebook: Organizational Type Classification\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nDescription\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nArts & Cultural\nArts organizations and cultural organizations, including those that protect community heritage\nBANGOR SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA, BRICK STORE MUSEUM, CHESAPEAKE SHAKESPEARE COMPANY\n\n\nCommunity\nOrganizations focused on directly helping people in their community and providing community services\nWOMENS COMMUNITY CENTER, FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER OF NORTHWEST OHIO, PELLA COMMUNITY FOOD SHELF\n\n\nEconomic\nOrganizations directly promoting economic improvement in an area\nFALLS CITY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, NEW ALBANY URBAN ENTERPRISE ZONE, MAIN STREET CORRIDOR DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION\n\n\nEducation\nSchools, universities, organizations that support schools, and those that provide direct education services\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, THOMPSON SCHOOL PTO, LITTLE RASCALS PRESCHOOL\n\n\nFoundations\nOrganizations focused on granting money or scholarships to others\nROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION, BVS FAMILY FOUNDATION\n\n\nHealthcare\nOrganizations that directly deliver care or support healthcare delivery\nST MARYS REGIONAL HEALTH CENTER, SOUTHERN TIER HEALTH CARE SYSTEM INC, CANCER RESOURCES FOR ELKHART COUNTY INC\n\n\nHobby & Sports\nShared interest and sports organizations\nGARDEN CLUB OF KENTUCKY INC, LAGUNA YOUTH BASEBALL LEAGUE, VILLA PARK BOXING CLUB\n\n\nHousing\nOrganizations that provide or manage housing\nBELLE APARTMENTS HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FUND CORPORATION, CAMPUS TOWERS SENIOR LIVING INC, HABITAT FOR HUMANITY INTERNATIONAL INC\n\n\nPolitical\nCivic participation and political organizations involved in decision-making or advocacy\nAMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION, LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS, ARIZONA ADVOCACY NETWORK\n\n\nProfessional\nProfessional societies and industry groups\nNATIONAL INDEPENDENT FLAG DEALERS ASSOCIATION, BEEFMASTER BREEDERS CATTLEWOMEN, AMERICAN CANCER ASSOCIATION\n\n\nReligious\nReligious institutions\nCROSSROADS CHRISTIAN CHURCH, NEW SPRINGS CHURCH, MANASSAS MOSQUE\n\n\nResearch & Think Tank\nThink tanks and research groups\nSOCIETY FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF MATERIAL AND PROCESS ENGINEERING, INSTITUTE FOR CONSERVATION ADVOCACY RESEARCH AND EDUCATION, AMERICAN COUNCIL FOR CAPITAL FORMATION CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH\n\n\nSocial & Fraternal\nOrganizations that bring people together (often based on shared identity)\nKNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS, ROTARY INTERNATIONAL, NATIONAL KAPPA KAPPA IOTA\n\n\nUnions\nLabor unions\nAMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY & MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES, FRESNO CITY EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION, CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION\n\n\nYouth\nOrganizations focused on working with and supporting youth\nBOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA, NEBRASKA 4-H FOUNDATION, CROSSWALK TEEN CENTER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💡 Tip: To scroll horizontally, hover over the table body — column headers are fixed and won’t scroll."

    "text": "MapAgora Dashboard\nWelcome to the MapAgora Dashboard, an interactive site that visualizes the availability, composition, and equity of civic opportunities across U.S. counties. This dashboard is part of the Mapping the Modern Agora project, hosted at the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University, which systematically measures civic infrastructure using large-scale administrative and digital trace data.\n\nMotivation 🚀\nToday, most people are disconnected from the democratic processes that allow us to engage, deliberate, and make decisions together. Civil society organizations are scattered, and opportunities for meaningful civic participation are often inaccessible.\nWe’re mapping the modern agora — a visual map of where and how people can engage with each other in the democratic process. By mapping civic opportunities, we aim to strengthen democracy by identifying areas that need more attention and support.\n\n\n📊 Civic Opportunity Dataset Construction 🛠\nTo create our datasets on the landscape of civic opportunity in America, we begin with the IRS Exempt Organizations Business Master File — a comprehensive registry of all tax-exempt organizations in the U.S. This registry serves as our sampling frame and includes a broad range of nonprofit entities, even those that don’t file annual tax returns.\nNext, we link IRS administrative records with data scraped directly from organization websites. Using a combination of machine learning and natural language processing, we identify the type of each organization and whether it provides civic opportunities such as volunteering, membership, public events, and engaging in civic or political action.\nThe resulting datasets cover over 1.7 million de-identified nonprofits and are aggregated at the ZIP code and county levels. Each county is scored along a five-point Civic Opportunity Index, with additional indicators for organizational composition and community demographics.\n\n\nAbout This Dashboard\nThis dashboard presents only a subset of the full MapAgora datasets. It includes:\n\nCounty-level aggregates of civic opportunity counts and organizational types\n\nInteractive visualizations of these county-level measures\n\nExplore the Dashboard\n\n🗺️ Interactive Map: View county-level civic opportunity scores, see how each place ranks, and examine the types of organizations driving civic access.\n\n📋 Interactive Table: Search, filter, and sort civic opportunity indicators across all U.S. counties, with comparisons to state and national benchmarks.\n\n⚠️ Important Note\nIt does not include either the full de-identified organization-level dataset of 1.7M+ nonprofits 🏢 or the ZIP code–level aggregates 📮. This dashboard is limited to county-level data only 🗺️.\nFor ZIP-level data and detailed metadata on individual organizations, please refer to the full data release 📂.\n\n\nData Access and Paper\n\nDataset 1: organization-level dataset of de-identified nonprofit organizations (1,774,798 rows \\(\\times\\) 17 columns)\n\n\n\nData descriptions\n\nThis dataset includes 1,774,798 de-identified nonprofit organizations.

This page offers prompts and reflections to help you begin exploring the dashboard and datasets—whether you’re curious about your own county or conducting place-based research.\n\n💡 Explore with Questions🔍 Critically Engage with the Data\n\n\nUse the following prompts to guide your exploration:\n\nWhat kinds of civic opportunity organizations are more common in rural vs. urban counties in your state?\nWhich counties have especially high or low civic opportunity scores? What might explain those patterns?\nHow does your county compare to others nearby—or to the national average?\nWhat does this data confirm or challenge about your understanding of civic life in your community or region?\n\n\n\nMapAgora offers a scalable and comprehensive map of America’s civic infrastructure—but no dataset is perfect. This dashboard is an invitation to explore, question, and extend what you see.\nIf you’re working in a specific place, you might: - Click into a few counties directly on the map, - Download the ZIP code–level dataset for more granular views, or - Use the organization-level dataset to reconstruct civic opportunity scores at the city level.\nWe encourage users to compare what they find here with external sources like Google Maps, Yelp, or local directories. This can help surface civic organizations that may not be captured in the dataset—such as informal neighborhood groups, mutual aid networks, or online communities.\nThese comparisons not only highlight what might be missing, but also why—whether due to registration status, online visibility, or organizational disclosure norms.\nEngaging with the data in this way helps refine place-based research, enrich local knowledge, and spark new questions about what counts—and what is counted—in civic life."
